## Purpose

Guide the process of creating well-structured git commits with meaningful commit messages. This skill ensures commits follow best practices and include proper attribution.

## Workflow

1. Check git status to see untracked and modified files
2. Review staged and unstaged changes with git diff
3. Examine recent commit messages for style consistency
4. Analyze changes and draft an appropriate commit message
5. Stage relevant files and create the commit
6. Verify the commit succeeded

## Instructions

When the user wants to commit changes:

### Step 1: Gather Context

Run the following commands in parallel to understand the current state:

```bash
# See all untracked and modified files (never use -uall flag)
git status

# See both staged and unstaged changes
git diff
git diff --staged

# See recent commit messages for style reference
git log --oneline -10
```

### Step 2: Analyze Changes

Review all changes (staged and unstaged) and determine:

- **Nature of changes**: New feature, enhancement, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.
- **Scope**: Which components or areas are affected
- **Purpose**: Why these changes were made (the "why" not the "what")

### Step 3: Draft Commit Message

Create a concise commit message following these guidelines:

- **First line**: Imperative mood, under 72 characters, summarizes the change
- **Use accurate verbs**: "add" for new features, "update" for enhancements, "fix" for bug fixes
- **Focus on "why"**: Explain the purpose rather than describing the code changes
- **Keep it brief**: 1-2 sentences for simple changes

### Conventional Commits

If the recent commit history follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format, the generated commit message must also follow that format. Conventional Commits use this structure:

```
<type>[(optional scope)]: <description>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `perf`.

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`
- `fix: resolve race condition in connection pooling`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `refactor(db): simplify query builder logic`
- `chore: bump dependency versions`

Look at the output of `git log --oneline -10` from Step 1. If the majority of recent commits use the `type:` or `type(scope):` prefix pattern, adopt the same format for the new commit message.

### Standard Commit Messages

If the commit history does not follow Conventional Commits, use a standard imperative format:

- `Add validation for user email input`
- `Fix race condition in connection pooling`
- `Update authentication flow to support OAuth2`
- `Refactor database queries for better performance`

### Step 4: Security Check

Before committing, verify:

- No sensitive files are being committed (.env, credentials.json, private keys)
- No secrets or API keys in the changes
- Warn the user if any suspicious files are detected

### Step 5: Stage and Commit

Stage specific files by name rather than using `git add -A` or `git add .`:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2

# Write the reviewed message to a temporary file, then commit it
git commit -F /path/to/commit-message.txt
```

### Step 6: Verify Success

After committing, run `git status` to confirm the commit succeeded.

## Important Rules

- **Never commit without user request**: Only create commits when explicitly asked
- **Never push code**: Do not run `git push` unless the user explicitly requests it
- **Never amend unless requested**: Always create new commits, not amend existing ones
- **Never skip hooks**: Do not use --no-verify or --no-gpg-sign unless user requests
- **Never force push**: Avoid destructive git operations
- **Never update git config**: Do not modify user's git configuration
- **Stage files explicitly**: Prefer specific file paths over `git add -A`
- **Always sign off**: Put a `Signed-off-by:` trailer before the final `Assisted-by:` trailer

## Attribution

Always include the `Assisted-by:` trailer as the final line of the commit message. Use the current harness or environment identity. Ask the user if that identity is unknown.

## Sign-off

Read the committer identity with `git var GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT`. Add a `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` trailer to the reviewed message file, immediately before `Assisted-by:`. If the identity is unavailable, ask the user which identity to use. Do not pass `--signoff`: Git appends that trailer after `Assisted-by:`, so the attribution would no longer be last.

For example, the message file should end with:

```text
Signed-off-by: Example User <user@example.com>
Assisted-by: <harness-name>
```

## Handling Pre-commit Hook Failures

If a pre-commit hook fails:

1. The commit did NOT happen - do not use --amend
2. Fix the issues identified by the hook
3. Re-stage the fixed files
4. Create a NEW commit (not amend)

## Example Usage

User: "Commit my changes"

Response:
1. Run git status and git diff to see changes
2. Analyze the modifications
3. Draft: "Add CODEOWNERS validation script and GitHub workflow"
4. Stage the specific files changed
5. Create the commit with a manual `Signed-off-by:` trailer followed by `Assisted-by:`
6. Confirm success with `git status` and inspect the final message with `git log -1 --format=%B`
