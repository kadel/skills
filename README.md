# Agent Skills

A collection of agent-neutral skills following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io) and managed with [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

These skills enhance AI coding assistants (such as Claude Code, Codex, and others) with domain knowledge, specialized workflows, and CLI integrations.

## Installation & Usage

Skills are installed and managed using `npx skills`. By default, skills install to the current project directory. Use `-g` to install globally, and `-a` to select specific target agents (e.g., `claude-code`, `codex`).

```bash
# Discover available skills in this collection
npx skills add kadel/skills --list

# Choose skills interactively
npx skills add kadel/skills

# Install a specific skill for the current project
npx skills add kadel/skills --skill commit

# Install globally for selected agents
npx skills add kadel/skills --skill commit -g -a claude-code codex

# List installed skills
npx skills list

# Update installed skills to latest versions
npx skills update

# Remove an installed skill
npx skills remove commit
```

## Contributing

Skills in this repository are agent-neutral and follow the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).

To scaffold a new skill in this repository:

```bash
npx skills init <skill-name>
```

Guidelines:
- Each skill must reside in its own root directory matching its canonical frontmatter `name`: `<name>/SKILL.md`.
- Keep skills self-contained; place supporting files in subdirectories (`references/`, `scripts/`, `examples/`).
- Do not introduce plugin wrapper directories, marketplaces, or client-specific frontmatter fields (`model`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`).
- Put version numbers under `metadata.version` (e.g. `metadata:\n  version: "0.1.0"`).
- Always update this README table when adding or renaming a skill.
- See [`create-skill/SKILL.md`](create-skill/SKILL.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for full instructions and best practices.

## Migration Guide

This repository was reorganized from a Claude Code plugin collection (`kadel/claude-plugins`) into a multi-agent skill collection (`kadel/skills`).

### For Existing Plugin Users

If you previously installed these as Claude Code plugins via `/plugin`:
1. Remove old plugin installations using your client's plugin removal command.
2. Reinstall desired skills using `npx skills`:
   ```bash
   npx skills add kadel/skills --skill <canonical-name> -a claude-code
   ```

### For Existing `npx skills` Users

If you previously installed skills pointing to historical nested paths (e.g., `plugins/...`):
1. Re-add skills from `kadel/skills` so paths and sources resolve cleanly:
   ```bash
   npx skills add kadel/skills --skill <canonical-name>
   ```

### Renamed Skills

Four skills have been updated to their canonical names. When specifying `--skill`, use the new canonical name:

| Old Historical Directory | New Canonical Name |
|---|---|
| `backstage-cr` | `backstage-custom-resource` |
| `git-commit` | `commit` |
| `ghostty-applescript` | `ghostty` |
| `documentation` | `review-documentation` |
